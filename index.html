            <h2>BENEFITS OF WALKING</h2>
            <p>Walking for 30 minutes a day or more on most days of the week is a great way to improve or maintain your overall health.
				If you can’t manage 30 minutes a day, remember ‘even a little is good, but more is better’.
				Walking with others can turn exercise into an enjoyable social occasion.
				See your doctor for a medical check-up before embarking on any new fitness program, 
				particularly if you are aged over 40 years, are overweight or haven’t exercised in a long time.</p>
            
			<p>To get the health benefits, try to walk for at least 30 minutes as briskly as you can on most days of the week.
			‘Brisk’ means that you can still talk but not sing, and you may be puffing slightly.
			Moderate activities such as walking pose little health risk but, if you have a medical condition,
			check with your doctor before starting any new exercise program of physical activity.</p>
            
			<p>If it’s too difficult to walk for 30 minutes at one time, do regular small bouts (10 minutes) three times per day and gradually build up to longer sessions.
			However, if your goal is to lose weight, you will need to do physical activity for longer than 30 minutes each day. 
			You can still achieve this by starting with smaller bouts of activity throughout the day and increasing these as your fitness improves.

			Physical activity built into a daily lifestyle plan is also one of the most effective ways to assist with weight loss and keep weight off once it’s lost.</p>
           
		    <p>Try to make walking a routine – for example, try to walk at the same time each day. 
			Remember, you use the same amount of energy, no matter what time of day you walk, so do what is most convenient for you.
			You may find that asking someone to walk with you will help make it a regular activity.
			Some people find that keeping an activity diary or log also makes it easier.</p>
            
			<p>The best way to warm up is to walk slowly. Start off each walk at a leisurely pace to give your muscles time to warm up, and then pick up the speed.
			Afterwards, gently stretch your leg muscles – particularly your calves and front and back thighs. Stretches should be held for about 20 seconds.
			If you feel any pain, ease off the stretch. Don’t bounce or jolt, or you could overstretch muscle tissue and cause microscopic tears,
			which lead to muscle stiffness and tenderness.</p>
